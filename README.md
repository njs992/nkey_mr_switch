# It's a tester. For keyswitches. Named Mr. Switch.
All the pcb and plate files are for KiCad. The plate is just a pcb with no wires.
I ordered stuff from JLCPCB.com. They did a good job, but the plate isn't going to be as cheap as when you order it because of the increased manufacturing time. They'll contact you afterward. It was still pretty cheap.
I use Kailh hotswap sockets and the Adafruit reverse mount LEDs. Currently I've used a SAMD51 Seeduino Xiao, but I think one of the RP2040 ones would be a better fit, as that should make it QMK compatible (with some custom work, obv).

# HAVE FUN :)

If you want to use it please leave Mr. Switch's face somewhere on there.
Maybe also give me a shoutout.
